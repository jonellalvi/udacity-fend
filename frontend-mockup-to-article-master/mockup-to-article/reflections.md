You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

1. **What new skills have you learned?**
  * I've learned a new editor, Atom, that feels more intuitive to me than Sublime does.
  * How to manage my time better--if I'm interrupted I can pick up where I left off.
  * A lot of the material in this section has been review--but I've learned confidence in that I didn't realize how much of HTML I remember from past learning experiences
2. **What has been easy?**
  * Learning the basic HTML tags again was easy--but a great review for me.
3. **What has been difficult?**
  * Deciding that this was what I wanted to do. I don't have much confidence in getting a job in this field. I am hoping the letter I wrote to myself and having the community here will help.
  * Believing I can do it.
  * Also, knowing what tag to use, given that there can be more than one way to do things. In this exercise, I had used the `<i>` tag for the quotation from the paper, then changed it to `<em>`. I thought about using <quote> but that makes it look different from the mock-up. So knowing what is being requested and making the decisions of what to put in the code based on incomplete information--that's difficult!
4. **How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?**
  * I've looked up lots of things on MDN.
  * I've googled a few things too (including a search for the Github Markdown cheatsheet!)
  * I kept going when I got a bit stuck since I knew that even if I got it wrong, it was okay--I could resubmit.
  * I didn't take too long obsessing over which tag to use. I picked something and moved on. Better to be done than to take time and energy waffling over what to do!
